Using a set of images in a folder specified by you, you can extract all data regarding these images: book title, author and even genre, using the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) as well as Google Books to obtain said information.

To use this program you'll only have to install the required packages and use the Python version 3.11.5.

From then on, you only need a folder with the images of the books you want studied and execute the program the following way:
  python main.py (for windows users)
  python3 main.py (for linux users)
